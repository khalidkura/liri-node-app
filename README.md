LIRI-Bot
A node command line app to retrieve information using the Twitter, Spotify, and OMDB APIs. The information retrieved will be logged to the console as well as a text file log.txt

Liri accepts four commands: spotify-this-song, my-tweets, movie-this, and do-what-it-says.

spotify-this-song
The spotify-this-song command will take any arguments following the command and log the information for the first song from the search results for that title. It will log the artist(s), the name of the track, the URL for a preview on Spotify, and the album. If no arguments are supplied, it will log the information for "The Sign" by Ace of Base.

For example, node liri spotify-this-song favorite song will run a Spotify API search for songs with the title "Favorite Song" and log the first result.

movie-this
The movie-this command will take any arguments following the command and log the information for the first movie from the search results for that title. It will log the title, the release year, the IMDB rating, the Rotten Tomatoes rating, the country of origin, the language, a brief plot snippet, and the actors. If no arguments are supplied, it will log the information for "Mr. Nobody".

For example, node liri spotify-this-song favorite movie will run a OMDB API search for movies with the title "Favorite Movie" and log the first result.

do-what-it-says
The do-what-it-says command will read the random.txt file and run the commands on each line, and log their output in the order they're listed in the file.

The do-what-it-says command cannot run itself. If do-what-it-says is in random.txt, the other commands will run, but instances of the do-what-it-says command will not run.
